# Maze
Maze Project - The program creates a perfect maze. 
Perfect in this context means a maze without any loops or closed circuits, and without any inaccessible areas.
The repository contains two files: One is a python file that asks for a maze size to be constructed from the user and the other
zipped file contains an executable file that when ran creates a 20 by 20 perfect maze.
