# Maze
Maze Project - The program creates a perfect maze. 
Perfect in this context means a maze without any loops or closed circuits, and without any inaccessible areas.
The repository contains two files: 
One is a python file that asks the user for a size and then begins constructing the maze with that value.
The other is a zipped file that contains an exe that when ran creates a 20 by 20 perfect maze.
